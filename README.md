# gRPC example - how to proxy duplex streaming

An example of how to proxy duplex stream using gRPC. 

```
npm install
node server.js
node proxy.js
node client.js
```

Then try to put some text into the console of `client.js`. The client is going to stream 
the text into the proxy. The proxy is going to stream data into server. The server is then 
streaming data back into Ëšthe proxy and proxy is streaming it back to client. 

It goes like this: 

```
client> hi
proxy>  Received {"value":"hi"} from client.
        Proxying, do your checks and so on... 
server> Received {"value":"hi"}.
proxy>  Sending {"value":"hi"} from server stream to client.
client> Echoing { value: 'hi' }
```

Here is output from all three consoles.

_client.js_
```$bash
hello guys
2019-03-31T16:35:04.736Z 'From proxy' { value: 'hello guys' }
```

_proxy.js_
```$bash
2019-03-31T16:35:04.731Z 'Received {"value":"hello guys"} from client.'
2019-03-31T16:35:04.734Z 'Proxying, do your checks and so on... '
2019-03-31T16:35:04.735Z 'Sending {"value":"hello guys"} from server stream to client.'
```

_server.js_
```$bash
2019-03-31T16:35:04.733Z 'Received {"value":"hello guys"}.'
```
